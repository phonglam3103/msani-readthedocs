About MolSanitizer
******************

**MolSanitizer (msani)** is a Python package for preparation (remove salts, tautomer standardization, stereoisomers enumeration, protonation) and filtering undesirable substructures (PAINS, reactive functional groups) for drug discovery projects. MolSanitizer is also capable of building DB2 files (for DOCK3.8) and PDBQT files (for AutoDock Vina) programs. Different conformational formats (SDF, Mol2) could also be generated by MolSanitizer.
